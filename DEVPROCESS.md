## **StackOv global architecture**

StackOv has organized with [SPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/) packages. Each package contains some logical part of the app.

> <small>This way was described by Apple in the articel - [Organizing Your Code with Local Packages](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/organizing_your_code_with_local_packages).</small>

<b>StackOv.xcodeproj</b> contains the main views of the app with global splitting for iOS and iPadOS platforms. MacOS version is available through the Catalyst.

### We have the next basic groups:

- [`Flows`](https://github.com/surfstudio/StackOv/tree/develop/Flows) contains all flows of the app. Each flow is an autonomous spm package which manage some group of screens (views) which has horizontal navigation. By the way, one flow could contain only one screen (view).
- [`Stores`](https://github.com/surfstudio/StackOv/tree/develop/Stores) contains all stores of the app. Each store is an autonomous spm package which generally is a connector between the service layer and the view layer.
- [`Services`](https://github.com/surfstudio/StackOv/tree/develop/Services) contains all services of the app such as some kind of network package or global managers.  
- `Modules` (the virtual group is managed by the XCode) contains all basic packages which help us to make this app.

### Swinject DI system

We use [Swinject framework](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject) to give each view, store, or service everything that they need.

All dependencies have managed in the [AppScript package](https://github.com/surfstudio/StackOv/tree/develop/AppScript). 

## **Git flow**

To work with git we use a popular tactic which was described [here](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model).

Our repo has the next structure of branches:

- `main`
- `develop`
- `feature/\d.+`
- `bug/\d.+`
- `hotfix/.+`

<b>Note 1</b>: `feature`, `bug` braches must have the number of some issue.

<b>Note 2</b>: We use next groups of labels: 
 - Prority: `Blocker`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`
 - Type of device: `Any device`, `iPad`, `iPhone`, `Mac Catalyst`
 - Type of activity: `Layout`, `WIP`, `blocked`, `help wanted`
 - Type of issue: `feature`, `bug`
 - Service marks: `Service task`, `documenation`, `duplicate`, `question`, `wontfix`

<b>Note 3</b>: Don't forget to link your pull request with the issue unless `hotfix` pull requests ([Github guid](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)).

<b>Note 4</b>: Please, if your local branch of some issues should be updated from some parent branch (develop, master) don't make `git merge` because this makes git history so unreadable. The best way is to rebase it to the parent.

> <small>To work with git much more cumfortable, you can use [Fork app](https://fork.dev).</small>

## **MVI design pattern**

Model-View-Intent design pattern. We use paradigm which has provided by [MobX js framework](https://mobx.js.org/README.html). 

> <small>To know more about what is MVI about, I recommend readin [this part of the article](https://cycle.js.org/model-view-intent.html#model-view-intent-what-mvc-is-really-about).</small>

Long story short, the model layer works with business logic through such as services, managers, or stores. However, stores usually work as the mediator between the view layer and the model layer. View layer subscribes to some store through publishing properties and will be notified when these properties have changed, but this layer cannot change these values directly. To change something inside a store the view layer must makes an action (intent). Consider the next example:

```swift
final class PageStore: ObservableObject {
    enum State {
        case content([Model])
        case loading
    }

    @Published private(set) var state: State = .loading

    func fetch() { ... }
}

struct PageView: View {
    @Store var store: PageStore

    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            switch store.state {
            case let .content(model):
                content(model)
            case .loading:
                Text("Loading")
                    .onAppear { store.fetch() }
            }
        }
    }
} 
```
